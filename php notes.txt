Below is to run a php command line without the HTML, of course this means,
it will not show on the browser and same with the first command line above.

<?php
echo 'Hello, World!';

IN php
- echo 'Hello World'; (string) is considered a statement.
- echo( 2 + 5 ) (integer) this is a mathematical expressions and we expect to have 7 as uotput.
   this is still considered as a statement.

Declaring a variable
 we use a dollar sign $ followed by myVar!
$myVar

'' demonstration of a non parsed string.(you cannot parse into it)
"" demonstration of a parsed string.(you can parse into it)

Variable names cannot start with a number!

everything within a php tag is a string!

TYpes of Data in php

$myInteger = 54;
$myFloat = 38.987;
$myBoolean = TRUE; // we can use either upper case or lower case.
$mySecondBoolean = false;
$myString = 'Hello, World!';
$myObject = new stdClass();
$myNull = NULL;
$myArray = array( $myInteger, $myFloat...) multiple values can be passed into it


Ilustrattion of where we are.

Linux
Apache
mySQL
PHP - programming scripting language

The easiest way to output in a browser in php is jusy yo type directly. Just typing is being served as a string!
echo is the second easiest!

METHODS
GET method is what you use when you are repeatedly visiting a site. (this will show and can be resued).
POST method is used when you want a more secure pass. (this should not show in your browser/ should be hidden)

Arrays
- for indexed arrays. to add an array you woud declare and empty array per below
$myIndexedArray[] = 'Lizard'; it then knows to put the array in the array at the end.

Class
- public allows us to add an array
- private prevents manipulation.
both instances should be declared on the propertoes and ot the class.

the key word NEW is used when you are making an objet from a class or just making an object!

Methods
- in methods we start with a construct.
- construct is a reserved key wrod.
- function __construct (the underscore is double) ( $name = '', $price = 0.00, $type = 'Uncategorized' )
- above is default value!
- $this->name is used to access properties from a class
- ob_start(); holds off data to pending publication.
- everthing between php tags will be echoed!
- ob_get_clean(); ob_get - gets the date declared in ob_start, clean then clears the output buffer created in ob_start
- NO output yet at this point!
- 

- when running our method, we do not need to write echo as out uotput is already running an echo.

- when starting a json file, you open p with a {}
- trying to accessing the data in json and using it as an output.

- dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/
- dirname gets the name of the path
- (__FILE__) magic fxn that searches and returns the path to get our current directory.
